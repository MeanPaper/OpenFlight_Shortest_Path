# Comments

You have made very good progress so far and have finished the data extraction and pre-processing. You have also completed the BFS algorithm and written some test cases for it. You have also started work on the A* algorithm.

The only suggestion I have is to have more test cases which are also a bit more comprehensive on the entire graoh (if possible, consider some edge case for the entire graph and write a test case to ensure your algorithms work on those edge cases also)
